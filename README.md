# ToDo List Project with React.js

This document outlines the structure and setup for a ToDo list project built using React.js.

## Project Overview

The ToDo list project aims to create a simple and intuitive application for managing tasks. Users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed, providing a straightforward interface for organizing daily activities.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: A package manager for JavaScript, used for installing and managing project dependencies.
- **Parcel**: A toolchain for setting up a new React.js project with a single command.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard React.js application layout, with the following key directories and files:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **`components/`**: Directory for React components.
    - **`TodoList.js`**: Component for rendering the list of tasks.
    - **`TodoItem.js`**: Component for rendering individual tasks.
    - **`AddTodoForm.js`**: Component for adding new tasks.
  - **`App.js`**: Main component that orchestrates the application.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for rendering the React application into the DOM.
- **`public/`**: Contains public assets and the HTML template for the application.
  - **`index.html`**: HTML template that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **`package.json`**: Manifest file that contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation file (you're reading it!).
